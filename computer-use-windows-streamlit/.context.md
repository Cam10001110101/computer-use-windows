# Computer Use Windows Streamlit

A Python-based automation tool that provides a web interface for executing computer automation tasks on Windows systems. The project combines the power of Python's automation capabilities with Streamlit's user-friendly interface creation.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Web Interface Layer** (streamlit.py)
   - Provides the user interface using Streamlit
   - Handles user input and result display
   - Maintains session state and UI updates

2. **Automation Core** (loop.py)
   - Manages the main automation loop
   - Processes user commands
   - Coordinates tool execution

3. **Tool Framework**
   - Base tool interface (tools/base.py) defining common functionality
   - Collection manager (tools/collection.py) for tool organization
   - Specialized tools for different automation tasks:
     - Bash command execution and shell operations
     - Computer system operations and monitoring
     - File editing and content management
     - Process and application execution

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide
   - Maintain modular structure
   - Keep UI logic separate from automation logic
   - Document all public interfaces

2. **Testing**
   - Write tests for all new functionality
   - Maintain test coverage above 80%
   - Use pytest fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Mock system operations in tests
   - Organize tests to mirror source structure

3. **Tool Development**
   - Inherit from base.py for new tools
   - Implement required interface methods
   - Add corresponding test file
   - Document tool capabilities and usage
   - Follow established error handling patterns

## Business Context

The project aims to simplify computer automation tasks on Windows systems by providing:
- User-friendly web interface
- Extensible automation framework
- Real-time execution feedback
- System operation abstractions
- Multiple launch methods (Batch and PowerShell)

Target users are system administrators and automation engineers who need to automate Windows operations through a web interface.

## Quality Assurance

Quality is maintained through:
1. Comprehensive test suite using pytest
2. High test coverage requirements
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Code review process
5. Automated testing of all components
6. Structured test organization

## Deployment and Operations

The application can be deployed on Windows Server environments:
1. Install Python and dependencies
2. Configure system permissions
3. Run the application using either:
   - run_app.bat for command prompt
   - run_app.ps1 for PowerShell
4. Access via web browser

Operations are managed through the web interface, with logging and monitoring available for system operations.
